         <h2>Mental Illness</h2>
         <p><a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-is-mental-illness">Mental illness</a> are health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or behavior (or a combination of these). Mental illnesses are associated with distress and/or problems functioning in social, work or family activities.
          <br><br>
        Mental health affects 1 in 4 people at some point in their lives so it is likely that at some point either you or someone you know will suffer from mental ill health. For some children, they grow up with a parent or parents who have mental health difficulties. The severity of the mental illness can change over time.</p>

        <h2>Sexual Abuse</h2>
        <p><a class="link" href="https://www.apa.org/topics/sexual-abuse/"><strong>Sexual Abuse</strong></a>   is unwanted sexual activity, with perpetrators using force, making threats or taking advantage of victims not able to give consent. Immediate reactions to sexual abuse include shock, fear or disbelief. Long-term symptoms include anxiety, fear or post-traumatic stress disorder. 
        <br><br>
        Child sexual abuse is a form of child abuse in which a child is abused for the sexual gratification of an adult or older adolescent. It includes direct sexual contact, the adult or otherwise older person engaging indecent exposure (of the genitals, female nipples, etc.) to a child with intent to gratify their own sexual desires or to intimidate or groom the child, asking or pressuring a child to engage in sexual activities, displaying pornography to a child, or using a child to produce child pornography.</p>

        <h2>Divorce</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/divorce"><strong>Divorce</strong></a>   is the dissolution of marriage, the process of terminating a marriage or marital union. Divorce usually entails the canceling or reorganizing of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage, thus dissolving the bonds of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law of the particular country or state.
          <br><br>
        Divorce laws vary considerably around the world, but in most countries, divorce requires the sanction of a court or other authority in a legal process, which may involve issues of distribution of property, child custody, alimony (spousal support), child visitation/access, parenting time, child support, and division of debt. In most countries, monogamy is required by law, so divorce allows each former partner to marry another person.</p>
